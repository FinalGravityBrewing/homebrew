  "body": "### About Us\r\nFinal Gravity is an Atlanta, GA based club that promotes homebrewing and appreciation of beer for beginners and experts alike. We meet every first Wednesday of the month at 7:30 PM to discuss the many aspects of home brewing. Through technical discussions, group brewing, and group experiments we strive to share knowledge and obtain the skills to become better brewers.  The club was started by Bob Sandage in 2005 and has been active in the Little 5 Points area ever since.  Visit our Facebook Groups page to get all the latest info as well as group discussion!! \r\n\r\n### Meetings\r\nMeetings are the first Monday of each month; with some possible adjustments for end of year holidays. We usually meet at 870 Inman Village Pkwy, with meetings lasting around 3 hours. Agenda usually includes (1) discussion of past and upcoming events, (2) evaluation of homebrews, with some picked for BJCP style judging, and (3) technical presentations on topics that are intended to further the knowledge and brewing proficiency for club members.\r\n\r\n### Group Brews\r\nSeveral times per year the club decides on a style of beer to brew in a group setting. Recipes are circulated and discussed and group brew sessions are done on our 50 gallon custom built system. We have a custom control panel and use Spike Brewing 50 gallon kettles. Our next group brew is June 25 2016.\r\n\r\n### Dues\r\nClub dues are $35 per calendar year. Club dues are used as seed money for this website,club-hosted competitions, barrels for group brews, tasting glasses, and shirts. You do not have to be a member to attend a club meeting.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"paypal-button.min.js?merchant=GMMEPY8TPV4VL\"\r\n    data-button=\"donate\"\r\n    data-name=\"My product\"\r\n    data-amount=\"35.00\"\r\n    async\r\n></script>\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nEmail: Finalgravitycraftbrewers@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPresident - Tad Kays\r\n\r\nTreasurer - Ivano Harris\r\n\r\nGroup Brew Czar - Shawn Bainbridge\r\n",
